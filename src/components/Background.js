            During my studies, I learned a wide variety of technologies both for
            front-end and back-end approaches ranging from the basics such as
            HTML, CSS to more complex approaches like game development, AI,
            Cloud among others. Also, we had an ICT project in which together with a team, we had to solve an actual problem for a client, in this case, we worked together with Valio.
