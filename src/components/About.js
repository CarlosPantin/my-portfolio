        <p>
          Hello, I'm [Your Name]. I'm a passionate front-end developer with a love for creating
          interactive and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy working with
          technologies like React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build beautiful and
          responsive websites.

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I love to [mention your hobbies or interests].
